# Capstone Labeller

This is a mini project for the purpose of curating, downloading and preprocessing video data for
SUTD's Capstone Team SHMAKT. We are a team of 2 Engineering Systems and Design and 5 Information
Systems Technology and Design students working on a machine learning application project for our
final year project.

The goal is to broadly understand occurrences of events, relationships between characters,
significance of objects, actions and places through video and some background data.

##Context for videos we are looking for:
- 2 - 4 people
- must be able to see from waist up (optional)
- indoor context
- in English
- duration of interest should be 2 minutes or less
- must have some action involved
